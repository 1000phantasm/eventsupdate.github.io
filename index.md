Hello, this is Xiaolu's events update page. I have a wide range of interests, expertise and experience in urban policy and is particularly passionate
about the right to housing, sustainable, equitable and just urban mobility, public health, and related equity issues in the Global South. I will put the link and the discription of the online events that I'm interested in here.
