Hello, this is Xiaolu's events update page. I have a wide range of interests, expertise and experience in urban policy and is particularly passionate
about the right to housing, sustainable urbanisation, equitable and just urban mobility, public health, and related policy issues. I will put the link and the discription of the online events and articles/reports related to urban issues in here.
